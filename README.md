## What is Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit created by Google for building natively compiled applications. It enables developers to create beautiful, fast, and native-looking applications for multiple platforms using a single codebase. With Flutter, you can build high-quality user interfaces and deploy them to mobile, web, and desktop platforms.

## Key Features

- **Single Codebase:** Write code once and deploy it on multiple platforms.
- **Expressive UI:** Create visually stunning and customizable user interfaces.
- **Fast Development:** Hot reload feature for quick development iteration.
- **Rich Set of Widgets:** Flutter provides a rich set of highly customizable widgets.
- **Native Performance:** Achieve native performance on all supported platforms.
